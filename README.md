# bamazon

This is a back-end eCommerce page that uses npm's inquirer to deliver prompts that allow the user to make purchases. The user is able to select a product by typing in an ID code. Once a purchase is completed, the inventory is updated.

# How to Run the App

Bamazon primarily uses these two node modules: [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [`mysql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql).

To run the module in the terminal, type in `node bamazonCustomer.js`.
